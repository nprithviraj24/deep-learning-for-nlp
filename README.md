## Natural Language Processing through Deep Learning

Objective: To buuld a knowledge distillation student network of BERT.

NLP for computer is defined as a way to decipher, analyse, and understand a human language. Disparate tasks involved in NLP:

- Parts of speech tagging.
- Parsing sentences.
- Named-Entity Recognition
- Semantic Role Labeling
- Sentiment Classification
- Machine Translation
- Question Answering
- Dialogue Systems
- Contextual Embeddings


##### Computers understanding words

- Word Embeddings
- Word2Vec
- Character Embedding
- Contextualized Word Embeddings




### Recurrent Neural Networks
